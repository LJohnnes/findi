findi
-------

A port of a port of sosumi. Find your iPhone through Apple's API.

Source from:

[comfuture's recordmylatitude](https://github.com/comfuture/recordmylatitude/blob/master/findmyiphone/__init__.py)

That was inspired by:

[tyler hall's sosumi](https://github.com/tylerhall/sosumi)

I will attempt to keep up with Apple's changing API, as it breaks horribly when they update the app and modify version numbers. Fair warning.

Use
-------

Initialize findmyiphone with your Apple ID.

```python
findi = FindMyIPhone('email@example.com', 'password')
```

List your devices.

```python
print findi.devices
```

Get the first devices location:

```python
iphone = findi.devices[0]
print iphone.latitude, iphone.longitude
```

Recording Your Location
-------
There is an example Heroku application called [findi-heroku-example](https://github.com/pearkes/findi-heroku-example) with instructions
for setting up a service that stores your location over a period of time.
